		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>The area on the Han River that is now occupied by Seoul has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, and it acquired strategic importance to the various kingdoms that controlled the Korean peninsula and grew to become a city during the early historic period. Seoul was founded as the capital of a unified nation in 1394 by General <em>Yi Sŏng-gye</em>, the founder of the <em>Chosŏn</em> dynasty.</p></div>

		<h2>People</h2>
			<p>The population of Seoul when it was established as the capital of the <em>Chosŏn</em> dynasty in the 14th century was about 100,000. It doubled in size by the 17th century, then remained stable until the end of the 19th century. It grew steadily from the beginning of the 20th century and reached 900,000 by the end of World War II (1945). After the war, many Koreans who had been living abroad came back to Korea; the majority of them settled in Seoul, as did millions of refugees from the north during and immediately after the Korean War. By 1960 some 2.5 million people were living in Seoul. With rapid urbanization beginning in the 1970s, the city drew migrants from throughout the country, and the population reached some 10 million in 1990. Since then the population has stagnated; new towns and satellite cities around Seoul have drawn some of the metropolitan area’s growth. The population is made up almost entirely of Korean citizens, who are almost all ethnically Korean. Foreign residents constitute a small but appreciable fraction of the populace; they are not concentrated in any particular areas but are distributed across the city.</p></div>

		<h2>Culture&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>The once-dominant <em>Confucian</em> culture—with its emphasis on respect for ancestors, age, and seniority—continues to influence Korean family, work, and social life, albeit to a lesser degree than in the past. In addition to other factors, such as economic status and position in a business hierarchy, age and marital status are among the determinants of relative seniority, and there is some expectation that even between social acquaintances these factors—especially age—will influence relations. Traditional family life is much involved with rituals marking life-cycle milestones and the observation of holidays and ancestral rites. The most important passages in a person’s life are the completion of a baby’s first 100 days, one’s marriage, and one’s 61st birthday. According to traditional Korean belief, the spirits of the departed do not leave the earth for several generations; thus, deceased parents and grandparents are still considered part of the family. Ancestral rites (cherye) are performed to honour them on death anniversaries and on major holidays. Two of the most important holidays are Sŏllal (Lunar New Year) and Chusŏk (harvest moon festival, often referred to as the Korean Thanksgiving), both observed according to the lunar calendar.</p></div>

		<h2>Food&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>Food is an important part of Korean cultural identity. In the diets of even the most Westernized urban dwellers, traditional Korean cuisine, which emphasizes grains—especially rice—and fresh vegetables, continues to occupy a dominant role even amid the popularity of pizza, hamburgers, sushi, Chinese food, and other foreign dishes. A Korean meal generally consists of rice, soup or stew, and a number of side dishes, almost invariably among them kimchi, or pickled vegetables. Such is the importance of kimchi in the national diet that an estimated 160 or more varieties have been identified, and there is a museum in Seoul dedicated to the dish. The most common type is the spicy paech’u (Chinese cabbage) kimchi. Although many families today buy most of their kimchi in supermarkets, many others still make their own. The traditional practice of kimjang, in which villages and families devoted several days in the autumn to preparing the winter supply of kimchi, is celebrated in such annual kimjang festivals as that held in the southwestern city of Kwangju. Other popular Korean dishes are bibimbap (rice mixed with vegetables, egg, a spicy sauce, and sometimes meat), jjajangmyŏn (noodles in a black-bean sauce), pulgogi (or bulgogi; marinated meat grilled over charcoal), and samgyet’ang (a soup of stewed whole chicken stuffed with rice and ginseng), which is eaten as a restorative, particularly during hot weather.</p></div>

		<h2>Media&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>Seoul is the primary setting for many famous K-Dramas, and as such, is a primary filming destination for many shows and K-pop videos. For example, one of my most favorite K-Dramas, <em>Familiar Wife</em>, about a man whose supernatural discovery turns his marriage on its head, is set in Seoul. As such, many locations are simply actual destinations scattered throughout the city: Ju-Hyeok's university was filmed in the actual University of Seoul. Many other locations, like diners, airports, and several other houses and buildings that made an appearance, are also real locations in Seoul. </p></div>
